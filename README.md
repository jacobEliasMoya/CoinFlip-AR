# CoinFlip AR

A gesture-powered AR app that lets you "flip" a virtual coin using hand gestures—no taps, no buttons. Built with Unity, AR Foundation, and soon MediaPipe for gesture recognition. A fun entry into the world of spatial interfaces, with plans to evolve into a Jarvis-like virtual assistant.

## How to Run
1. Clone repo  
2. Open in Unity (2022 LTS)  
3. Install AR Foundation and ARCore plugin  
4. Deploy to Android device

## What’s Next
- Hand gesture detection (flick, catch)  
- Physics-driven realist flipping  
- Voice + AI assistant integration
